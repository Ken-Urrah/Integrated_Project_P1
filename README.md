# Integrated Project: Understanding Maji Ndogo's Agriculture
Â© ExploreAI Academy

## Overview
In this project, I applied all of the skills I learned in Pandas to analyze agricultural data for Maji Ndogo. The project focuses on exploring datasets, performing data cleaning, and deriving insights to understand agricultural patterns and challenges in the region. This work demonstrates proficiency in data manipulation, analysis, and visualization using Python and Pandas.

## Project Goals
- Clean and preprocess agricultural datasets for analysis.
- Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) to uncover trends and patterns.
- Visualize key insights using Pandas and related libraries.
- Provide actionable recommendations based on the data.

## Files
- `Integrated_Project_P1.ipynb`: The main Jupyter notebook containing the complete code, data analysis, visualizations, and findings.
- `Maji_Ndogo_farm_survey_small.db`: SQLite database containing the agricultural dataset.

## Dataset
The project uses a SQLite database (`Maji_Ndogo_farm_survey_small.db`) for analysis.
- If included in the repository: Download it directly from this repository.
- If hosted externally (for large files): Download the dataset from [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/file/d/your-file-id/view?usp=sharing).
- Place the `.db` file in the same directory as `Integrated_Project_P1.ipynb` before running the notebook.

## Setup Instructions
To run the project locally:
1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Ken-Urrah/Integrated_Project_P1.git
